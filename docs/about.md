# About Me

This is a short summary of myself, work habits and what motivates me.

- I am passionate about writing high quality code and futureproofing what I develop for scale and extensibility.
- I would describe myself as a bit of a perfectionist, but I am always willing to compromise and love discussing ideas and working with others to come up with the best possible solution.
- I’m passionate about automation and reducing future work for myself and my team.
- I like to be organised and have a clear plan of what I’m doing.
- I love learning new things from others and experimenting with and exploring new ideas.
- I’m not shy about putting forward new ideas, but in general am relatively quiet.
- If I have the time to spare, I genuinely enjoy helping others with their work, listening, and talking out problems with them.

For those interested in personality types I am an INFJ type.
