I am passionate about writing high quality code and futureproofing what I develop for scale and extensibility. I would describe myself as a bit of a perfectionist, but I am always willing to compromise and love discussing ideas and working with others to come up with the best possible solution. I\u2019m passionate about automation and reducing future work for myself and my team. I like to be organised and have a clear plan of what I\u2019m doing. I love learning new things from others and experimenting with and exploring new ideas. I\u2019m not shy about putting forward new ideas, but in general am relatively quiet. If I have the time to spare, I genuinely enjoy helping others with their work, listening, and talking out problems with them. For those interested in personality types I am an INFJ type.
